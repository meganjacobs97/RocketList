# RocketList

## Description
RocketList is a website that we pulled inspiration from Craigslist, Yahoo Answer, and Reddit. It allows for different topics and for people to make a post where others can make comments. We also added a feature that let users join chat rooms of a specific post so that they can discuss in real time what ever they wanted to.

## Installation
You will need to `npm install` to get all of the npm packages.

Also note that this application has separate servers that handle the application database and one that handles the chat.
